# ToyotaBase

ToyotaBase is a work-in-progress project containing a Toyota car database. On our website, the user can choose specific categories such as vehicle type, color, price, etc. Given those different categories, the website will display all entries in the database that correspond with it.

The programming languages we use are TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, Node JS, Express, and MySQL.
